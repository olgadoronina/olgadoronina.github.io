I'm postdoctoral researcher in the [Computational Science Center](https://www.nrel.gov/computational-science/) 
in [National Renewable Energy Lab](https://www.nrel.com). My research interests include modeling and simulating turbulent flows with an 
emphasis on the development of new data science and machine learning modeling approaches.
Currently, I am working on developing a surrogate model of non-ideal reacting 
flows in an oxy-combustor and building a computational tool for wind turbine blade representation.
