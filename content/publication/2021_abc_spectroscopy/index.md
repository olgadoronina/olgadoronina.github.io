abstract: "Given spatially sparse or lower dimensional experimental measurements, approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) 
and numerical simulations can be used to estimate unknown characteristics of complex multi-physics engineering systems. 
Here we describe the ABC approach and use it to estimate the speed of high-temperature gases exiting an 
industrially-relevant catalytic burner, as well as to estimate the completeness of combustion within the burner. 
Using vertical profiles of absorption-weighted average temperature from laser absorption spectroscopy (LAS) at three 
different burner operating conditions, we combine ABC and large eddy simulations (LES) to generate posterior 
distributions of inflow speeds and heat addition characteristics above the burner. We show that the ABC method 
correctly estimates trends in the inflow speed for different conditions, and we find that there is a strong likelihood 
of incomplete combustion for higher equivalence ratios. We evaluate the predictive capability of the approach using 
an observing system experiment, indicating that the ABC method, when combined with LES, is able to accurately predict 
LAS measurements. We thus demonstrate that ABC is an effective tool for obtaining additional insights from available 
experimental measurements, thereby improving understanding of real-world engineering systems."
