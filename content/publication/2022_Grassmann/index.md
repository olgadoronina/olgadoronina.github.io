abstract: "Airfoil shape design is a classical problem in engineering and manufacturing. Our motivation is to combine principled physics-based considerations for the shape design problem with modern computational techniques informed by a data-driven approach. Traditional analyses of airfoil shapes emphasize a flow-based sensitivity to deformations which can be represented generally by affine transformations (rotation, scaling, shearing, translation). We present a novel representation of shapes which decouples affine-style deformations from a rich set of data-driven deformations over a submanifold of the Grassmannian. The Grassmannian representation, informed by a database of physically relevant airfoils, offers (i) a rich set of novel 2D airfoil deformations not previously captured in the data, (ii) improved low-dimensional parameter domain for inferential statistics informing design/manufacturing, and (iii) consistent 3D blade representation and perturbation over a sequence of nominal shapes."
