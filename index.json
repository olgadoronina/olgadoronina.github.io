The ABC approach does not require the direct computation of a likelihood function, thereby enabling substantially faster estimation of un-known parameters as compared to full Bayesian analyses. The approach also naturally provides uncertainties in parameter estimates, avoiding the artificial certainty implied by optimization methods for determining unknown parameters. Details of the ABC approach are described, including the use of a Markov chain Monte Carlo technique to accelerate the parameter estimation, and unknown model parameters are estimated based on turbulence kinetic energy reference data for four impulsively sheared homogeneous turbulence test cases, as well as periodically sheared homogeneous turbulence for five different shearing frequencies.

In order to reduce memory requirements, here we propose the use of approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) in place of the optimization step, thereby yielding an autonomic closure implementation that trades memory-intensive for processor-intensive computations.

For numerical simulation we use the EBR scheme on meshes of different types. We compare results to the benchmark solution and we also compare different approaches to numerical simulation of the problem.\n","date":1362096000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590295052,"objectID":"c79979d77f83594d87325b05acabb690","permalink":"https:olgadoronina.github.io/publication/2013_vortex/","publishdate":"2013-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2013_vortex/","section":"publication","summary":"We consider a linear sound scattering by an isolated vortex as one of the fundamental problems in order to investigate an interaction of the vortex flow and acoustic waves.
