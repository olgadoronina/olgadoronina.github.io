For numerical simulation, we also use a scheme based on the quasi-one-dimensional reconstruction of the 5th order of accuracy. Calculations are performed using the parallel research code NOISEtte (KIAM RAS).\nWe give the calculational results of the plane acoustic wave scattering by isoentropic Gaussian-core vortex of a constant velocity circulation and demonstrate the convergence of solutions to the benchmark solution.

It is found that in both cases the results are almost the identical for the same number of nodes.\nFurther, we consider the problem of the cylindrical point source acoustic wave scattering by the Rankine vortex. We carry out the calculations on unstructured meshes and compare the results of different approaches to the problem: a finite-volume approach (NOISEtte), a finite element approach (Actran DGM) and a finite-difference Cabaret scheme.\nIn particular, the results confirm that the software system NOISEtte and the used method can be successfully applied to the numerical simulation of interaction between acoustic waves and vortex structures.\n","date":1362096000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590436604,"objectID":"c79979d77f83594d87325b05acabb690","permalink":"https:olgadoronina.github.io/publication/2013_vortex/","publishdate":"2013-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2013_vortex/","section":"publication","summary":"We consider a linear sound scattering by an isolated vortex as one of the fundamental problems in order to investigate an interaction of the vortex flow and acoustic waves.

There are two common approaches to reduce the cost of such simulations:\n   Large-Eddy Simulations (LES), which directly resolve turbulence on large scales and use subgrid-scale (SGS) models to represent small-scale physics\n   Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approaches, which resolve only averaged quantities and model turbulent fluctuations\n  However, there is no universally accurate turbulence model in either of these approaches. Besides that, all models rely on empirical coefficients that we must calibrate for different flows and geometries.\nWe suggest using the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) methods, also known as likelihood-free methods. ABC is a data-driven approach, which uses experimental or higher fidelity data to approximate the probability distribution of model parameters. As a result, we can choose model parameters and quantify their uncertainty based on (or even sample from) this estimated probability distribution.\nABC is based on the Bayesian approach but does not require knowing the analytical expression for a likelihood function. The primary advantages of ABC are its lower cost relative to full Bayesian methods and its flexibility in parameter estimation for complex models, e.g., turbulence models, which consist of partial differential equations.\nWe created a framework called TurbABC for turbulent model parameters estimation. TurbABC combines ABC with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, an adaptive proposal, and calibration steps to accelerate the parameter estimation process. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of TurbABC by estimating parameters of:\n  nonlinear SGS closures using reference data from direct numerical simulations of homogeneous isotropic turbulence\n  nonequilibrium anisotropy RANS closure in homogeneous turbulent flow with rapidly changing strain tensor\n  RANS model parameters estimation in inhomogeneous turbulent flow (axisymmetric transonic bump)\n  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590436604,"objectID":"22dc0f5ac1fbda1b88e752f820cd1828","permalink":"https:olgadoronina.github.io/project/abc_turbulence_modeling/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/abc_turbulence_modeling/","section":"project","summary":"Turbulence model development using Approximate Bayesian Computation.","tags":["ABC","LES","RANS","Turbulence"],"title":"Using ABC for turbulence model calibration","type":"project"}]
