The ABC-IMCMC approach avoids the need to directly compute a likelihood function during the parameter estimation, enabling a substantial speed-up and greater flexibility as compared to full Bayesian approaches. The method also naturally provides uncertainties in parameter estimates, avoiding the artificial certainty implied by many optimization methods for determining model parameters. In this study, we outline details of the present ABC-IMCMC approach, including the use of an adaptive proposal and a calibration step to accelerate the parameter estimation process. We demonstrate the approach by estimating parameters in two nonlinear SGS closures using reference data from direct numerical simulations of homogeneous isotropic turbulence. We show that the resulting parameter values give excellent agreement with reference probability density functions of the SGS stress and kinetic energy production rate in a priori tests, while also providing stable solutions in forward LES (i.e., a posteriori tests) for homogeneous isotropic turbulence. The ABC-IMCMC method is thus shown to be an effective and efficient approach for estimating unknown parameters, including their uncertainties, in SGS closure models for LES of turbulent flows.","tags":null,"title":"Parameter Estimation for Subgrid-Scale Models Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo Approximate Bayesian Computation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Olga Doronina","Scott Murman","Peter Hamlington"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1574756640,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611892939,"objectID":"358e53a8b22a48754b207fee281ecc16","permalink":"https://olgadoronina.github.io/talk/aps_2019/","publishdate":"2019-11-26T08:24:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/aps_2019/","section":"talk","summary":"RANS model parameters estimation in inhomogeneous turbulent flow (axisymmetric transonic bump) using Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC).","tags":["ABC","RANS"],"title":"Approximate Bayesian Computation for Parameter Estimation in RANS Turbulence Models","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

Understanding the sound generation process is essential for many practical applications.\nWhen turbulence is represented by a distribution of localized vortices with certain static properties, the acoustic field scattered by such a flow is a superposition of scattered acoustic fields from each vortex. Therefore, the description of the elementary event of sound scattering sound by an isolated vortex can be used to predict the impact of turbulence on the acoustic field.\nFor the numerical simulation of this problem, we used a linear approximation of the mathematical model. This approximation is quite realistic because it reveals the main properties of the studied phenomena. Thus, we modeled the problem using a system of linearized Euler equations, in which a vortex is defined as a background field.\nOne of the goals of this study was to test the ability of the EBR (Edge-Based Reconstruction) numerical scheme to model considered problems on unstructured grids and to assess its accuracy and efficiency compared to other approaches. Thus, we used the EBR scheme (the fifth-order scheme based on the quasi-one-dimensional reconstruction), implemented in a highly parallel research code NOISEtte (KIAM RAS).\nFirst, we showed the simulation results of the plane acoustic wave scattering by isentropic Gaussian-core vortex with a constant circulation velocity. We also provided the study of grid convergence to the benchmark solution. Besides Cartesian grids, we used quasi-uniform unstructured triangular grids and demonstrated that the results are almost identical for the same number of grid points.\nWe also consider the problem of the cylindrical point source acoustic wave scattering by the Rankine vortex. We perform simulations on unstructured grids and compare the results of different numerical approaches: a finite-volume approach (NOISEtte EBR), a finite element approach (Actran DGM), and a finite-difference (Cabaret scheme).\nThe results confirm that NOISEtte and its numerical method can be successfully used to simulate the interaction between acoustic waves and vortex structures.\n","date":1362096000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611892939,"objectID":"c79979d77f83594d87325b05acabb690","permalink":"https://olgadoronina.github.io/publication/2013_vortex/","publishdate":"2013-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2013_vortex/","section":"publication","summary":"We studied linear sound scattering by an isolated vortex to investigate the interaction of the vortex flow and acoustic waves.

There are two common approaches to reduce the cost of such simulations:\n   Large-Eddy Simulations (LES), which directly resolve turbulence on large scales and use subgrid-scale (SGS) models to represent small-scale physics\n   Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approaches, which resolve only averaged quantities and model turbulent fluctuations\n  However, there is no universally accurate turbulence model in either of these approaches. Besides that, all models rely on empirical coefficients that we must calibrate for different flows and geometries.\nWe suggest using the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) methods, also known as likelihood-free methods. ABC is a data-driven approach, which uses experimental or higher fidelity data to approximate the probability distribution of model parameters. As a result, we can choose model parameters and quantify their uncertainty based on (or even sample from) this estimated probability distribution.\nABC is based on the Bayesian approach but does not require knowing the analytical expression for a likelihood function. The primary advantages of ABC are its lower cost relative to full Bayesian methods and its flexibility in parameter estimation for complex models, e.g., turbulence models, which consist of partial differential equations.\nWe created a framework called TurbABC for turbulent model parameters estimation. TurbABC combines ABC with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, an adaptive proposal, and calibration steps to accelerate the parameter estimation process. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of TurbABC by estimating parameters of:\n  nonlinear SGS closures using reference data from direct numerical simulations of homogeneous isotropic turbulence\n  nonequilibrium anisotropy RANS closure in homogeneous turbulent flow with rapidly changing strain tensor\n  RANS model parameters estimation in inhomogeneous turbulent flow (axisymmetric transonic bump)\n  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611892939,"objectID":"22dc0f5ac1fbda1b88e752f820cd1828","permalink":"https://olgadoronina.github.io/project/abc_turbulence_modeling/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/abc_turbulence_modeling/","section":"project","summary":"Turbulence model development using Approximate Bayesian Computation.","tags":["ABC","LES","RANS","Turbulence"],"title":"Using ABC for turbulence model calibration","type":"project"}]
