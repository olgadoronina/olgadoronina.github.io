The dynamic mesh adaptation is used to improve the accuracy. The mesh adaptation method in use is built on the base of nodes-redistribution techniques. Its implementation implies the solution of additional differential equation governing the mesh movement. The method allows to keep a topology of the initial mesh and does not increase significantly the computational costs. The technology is developed for 2D formulations and verified on model problems.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Turbulence Model Development Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo Approximate Bayesian Computation</title><link>https:olgadoronina.github.io/publication/2019_abc_rans/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https:olgadoronina.github.io/publication/2019_abc_rans/</guid><description>&lt;p>Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is used in this study to estimate unknown model parameter values, as well as uncertainties, in a nonequilibrium anisotropy closure for Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations. The ABC approach does not require the direct computation of a likelihood function, thereby enabling substantially faster estimation of un-known parameters as compared to full Bayesian analyses. The approach also naturally provides uncertainties in parameter estimates, avoiding the artificial certainty implied by optimization methods for determining unknown parameters. Details of the ABC approach are described, including the use of a Markov chain Monte Carlo technique to accelerate the parameter estimation, and unknown model parameters are estimated based on turbulence kinetic energy reference data for four impulsively sheared homogeneous turbulence test cases, as well as periodically sheared homogeneous turbulence for five different shearing frequencies. The ABC method is shown to yield parameter values for the nonequilibrium anisotropy closure that provide good agreement between model results and the reference data.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Autonomic Closure for Turbulent Flows Using Approximate Bayesian Computation</title><link>https:olgadoronina.github.io/publication/2018_autonomic_abc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https:olgadoronina.github.io/publication/2018_autonomic_abc/</guid><description>&lt;p>Autonomic closure is a new technique for achieving physically accurate adaptive closure
of coarse-grained turbulent flow governing equations, such as those solved in large eddy simulations (LES). Although autonomic closure has been shown in recent a priori tests to more
accurately represent unclosed terms than do dynamic versions of traditional LES models, the
optimization step used in the approach introduces large matrices that must be inverted, resulting in high memory usage. In order to reduce memory requirements, here we propose the use
of approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) in place of the optimization step, thereby yielding
an autonomic closure implementation that trades memory-intensive for processor-intensive
computations. These computations can be handled by co-processors such as general purpose
graphical processing units that are becoming increasingly available on petascale supercomputers. In this paper, we outline the formulation of ABC-enabled autonomic closure and present
initial results demonstrating the accuracy of the approach.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Numerical study of acoustic radiation dynamics of a Rankine vortex</title><link>https:olgadoronina.github.io/publication/2016_vortex/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https:olgadoronina.github.io/publication/2016_vortex/</guid><description>&lt;p>The paper investigates a problem of sound radiation by a perturbed Rankine vortex, which is important for understanding the nature of vortex flows. We present numerical simulation results for quadrupole and higher mode radiations and consider the structure and dynamics of tonal acoustic radiation generated by a vortex in detail. We also describe the transition of a Rankine vortex to a perturbed state under small external perturbation. Numerical simulations are performed using the EBR (Edge-based reconstruction) scheme implemented in NOISEtte.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Numerical simulation of acoustic waves scattering by isolated vortex structures</title><link>https:olgadoronina.github.io/publication/2013_vortex/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https:olgadoronina.github.io/publication/2013_vortex/</guid><description>&lt;p>The problem of sound scattering by an isolated vortex is not only interesting by itself but also is fundamental for understanding the interaction between acoustic waves and vortex flow, including the process of sound generation by turbulence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When turbulence is represented by a distribution of localized vortices with certain static properties, the acoustic field scattered by such flow is a superposition of scattered acoustic fields from each vortex. Therefore, the description of an elementary event, scattering of sound by an isolated vortex, can be used to predict the impact on the acoustic field of the turbulent flow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the numerical simulation of this problem, we use a linear approximation of the mathematical model. This approximation is quite realistic because it reveals the main properties of the studied phenomena. Thus we model the problem using a system of linearized Euler equations, in which a vortex is defined as a background field.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We use EBR (Edge-Based Reconstruction) numerical scheme, the 5th order scheme based on the quasi-one-dimensional reconstruction, implemented in highly parallel research code NOISEtte (KIAM RAS). One of the goals of this study is to test the EBR scheme&amp;rsquo;s ability to model such problems on unstructured grids and to assess its accuracy and efficiency compared to other approaches.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
